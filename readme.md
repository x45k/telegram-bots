## Building Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/x45k/telegram-bots.git
   ```
2. CD into the bot, for example:
    ```bash
    cd ./telegram-bots/facts/
    ```
3. Change your token:
    ```js
    const token = 'your-token';
    ```
    (Replace 'your-token' with your telegram bot token)

4. Install the dependencies:

    npm install node-telegram-bot-api axios

    (Keep in mind axios may not be needed, it depends on the chosen bot)
